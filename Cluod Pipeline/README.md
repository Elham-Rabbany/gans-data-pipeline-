# Real-Time Data Pipeline for GAN Insights

This project uses **Google Cloud Scheduler** to collect weather and flight data at regular intervals. The data helps **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** analyze patterns and provide real-time insights.

## What It Does

- **Schedules Tasks**: Google Cloud Scheduler runs the data collection automatically at set times.
- **Collects Data**: Gathers **weather** and **flight** arrival information.
- **Provides Insights**: Sends the data to GANs for analysis and insights.
